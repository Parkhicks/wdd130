    <h2>Parker Hicks</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Parker Hicks.I'm from South Jordan Utah, I have 3 siblings and growing up was a blast. This is my first semester in my current major which is Virtual Construction Design with a minor in computer programming. Last semester I transferred from mechanical engineering.  I should be done in about 2 and a half years and I then hope to build and design temples. I'm excited to learn and grow here at BYUI!</p>
    <p>I'm excited to learn more in this class specifically about Html and in the end I wat to be able to program my own websites. This is my second year here at BYUI and its a blast. I like to play board games, the outdoors, offroading, boating, and exploring.</p>
    <p>I was born into the church so I've been a member for 21 years now. I'm excited to get to know everyone in this class</p>
